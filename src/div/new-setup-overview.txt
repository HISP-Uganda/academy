SETUP OVERVIEW (NEW NOV 2014 - Ubiquiti + Mac)
----------------------------------------------

- mac min (mac) runs postgres, tomcat, nginx (and php/moodle if needed)
- Ubiquiti EdgeRouter is the router and runs DHCP servers for two networks
- Two networks:
    server: 192.168.1.0/24 --> Mac
    client: 192.168.2.0/24 --> Wifi Access Points (same SSID for both)
- The mac server has a reserved, static IP on 192.168.1.2
- The home page is reached at http://192.168.1.2
- Nginx runs as a proxy on mac:80 for tomcat, www, PHP etc.

Connecting it all:
------------------

All equipment should be named and marked. There are TWO identical 
setups which are referred to as #1 and #2. Hence, equipment is marked
with a name + a number tag:

Examples:
    Router of setup 2:  "Router #2"
    5/2.4 Ghz AP of setup 1: "5 + 2.4 AP #1"

ONLY interconnect equipment with the same number tag.

Access points:
    The APs are configured to receive power over ethernet (PoE).
    The AP Pro unit (marked 5 + 2.4 #x) needs 48V power
    The AP LR (Long range) unit needs 24V.
    DO NOT connect an AP to a different port. The results might be bad.

Connections:
    Ports on the router are marked eth0 -> eth4.
    APs
        5+2.4 (48V, blue LED) -> eth2
        2.4  (24V, orange LED) -> eth3
    Servers
        Mac -> eth0

    eth1 is disabled.
    eth4 is switched with eth2 and eth3 but has no PoE configured.
    You can connect directly to eth4 to configure the APs (see other docs)
    or extend the network with another AP, switch, whatever.
