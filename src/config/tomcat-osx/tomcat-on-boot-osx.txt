Running Tomcat on boot in OS X:
-------------------------------

Boot daemons are configured and ran on OS X using launchctl.
There needs to be a wrapper script for tomcat startup and shutdown, as
well as a LaunchDaemon .plist file.

1. Put the file launchd_wrapper.sh in $CATALINA_HOME/bin
2. Put the file tomcat.plist in /Library/LaunchDaemons

Tomcat should now start on boot.

To start, load manually use:
    sudo launchctl /Library/LaunchDaemons/tomcat.plist -s {load|unload}
