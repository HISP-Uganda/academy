There are two identical instances of the following (Unifi+mac) setup 

Overview: Ubiquiti UniFi AP x 2 + EdgeRouter PoE
-------------------------------------------
192.168.1.2 > mac / dhis / postgres / nginx

ssid: DHIS2_1 and DHIS2_2
router admin: 192.168.1.1 admin:admin or ubnt:ubnt
dhcp pool: 192.168.2.0/24
ip range: 192.168.2.20 > 192.168.2.240
security: none.

About UniFi APs:
----------------
The APs are managed using the Ubiquiti UniFi Controller. 
This is a java server + web interface which runs on your machine and is downloaded 
from http://www.ubnt.com/download/ ---> Pick UniFi --> UniFi Controller.

Unfortunately, for Ubuntu (linux) installation is a bit cumbersome: 
http://www.tmrees.com/how-to-install-a-unifi-controller-v3-on-ubuntu-14-04/

Connect to the same (ether)net as the routers. E.g. directly into port eth4
on the router (assign yourself an 192.168.1.*-IP) and run the software.

NOTE that managing the access points themselves should not really be necessary.
They are configured to use DHCP from the router and should _JUST_WORK_ as
long as they are connected to the appropriate ports on the routers.

The APs can be powered using PoE (Power over Ethernet). This is turned on
in the config which is provided. 
The 5+2.4 Ghz AP required 48V PoE and the 2.4 only one requires 24V. It
is therefore IMPORTANT to connect them in their MARKED ports on the router.
PoE can be reconfigured in the router control interface if need be.
